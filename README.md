# Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Industry 

##  Project Objective
Predict churn and derive actionable strategies to retain customers in a highly competitive telecom market.


##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, ELI5)
- SQL (MySQL queries for analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard and visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook


##  Steps Involved
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
2. Churn Prediction Model (binary classification using Scikit-learn)
3. SQL Analysis (KPIs, churn rate, segments)
4. Customer Segmentation (Loyal, At Risk, Dormant)
5. Dashboard in Power BI
6. Final Summary Report (PDF + PPT)
